## 1. What was the bug?

The bug was the two parameters are using the type of string. When they added together, concatenation happened. Hence, 

when num1 and num2 are 1 and 2, the result turned our to be 12.

## 2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix

I fix it by using function Number(), this functoin can convert its argument to the numerical value.
